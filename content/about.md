<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>
Campus Atlas was born out of a desire to improve the campus experience for students, faculty, and visitors alike. As students we experienced firsthand the frustration and time wasted in navigating a large and complex campus. We recognized that the current solutions available for indoor mapping and navigation were limited and did not meet the needs of modern campus-goers. That's why we started Campus Atlas - to create a mobile application that provides comprehensive indoor maps, navigation, accessibility features, and community engagement tools to make campus life easier and more enjoyable. Our team brings together a diverse range of skills and experiences, from business to computer science, united by a common goal of making the campus experience better for everyone. At Campus Atlas, we are committed to enhancing the campus experience by developing innovative solutions that solve real-world problems.
